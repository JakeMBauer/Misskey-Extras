* **Description**: This is a plugin that lets you immediately view a preview of
your post from within the post form, similar to functionality in Pleroma's

You can enable always showing a preview before submitting a post by going to:

`Settings → Plugins → Manage plugins → Settings button of "Basically Preview EN"`
